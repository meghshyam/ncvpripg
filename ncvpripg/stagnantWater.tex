\begin{abstract}
Recently, in urban areas there has been a sharp increase in dengue and malaria.
One of the major reason for this is suspected to be the amount of stagnant
water around residencies. There are many areas around urban residential places
such as terraces of high rise buildings, and shades above windows
(popularly known as `chhajja') that are hard to reach and hence to inspect. We
use quadcopter to inspect such areas and detect whether there is stagnant water.

\section{Introduction}
Dengue~\cite{WHO15Dengue} and Malaria~\cite{WHO15Malaria} are among the deadly
diseases common in at least 100 countries in Asia, the Pacific, the Americas,
Africa, and the Caribbean. In India itself there are around one million Malaria
cases ~\cite{NVBDP_Malaria} and fourty thousand cases of dengue
~\cite{NVBDP_Dengue} in year 2014. The disease is transmitted by the biting of
mosquitoes and if not appropriately treated, people may have recurrences of the
disease months later \cite{Cecilia14}. These mosquitoes flourish during rainy seasons but can breed
in water-filled flower pots, plastic bags, and cans year-round. Stagnant water
is major site for breeding of these mosquitoes.

The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites by using
mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito-control measures such as
spraying insecticides and draining standing water.  Even though major measures
are in exercise since 90’s till now, we have not succeeded in eradicating these
diseases. One of the major reasons behind this is existence of water-puddles
around urban residential places.

Some areas such as high rise buildings' terraces, construction sites, area
near water storage (having possible leakages/overflows) etc. does not attract
attention easily. So, we need an effective mechanism to keep an ``eye'' on such
areas to detect presence of stagnant water. 

Microsoft \cite{Microsoft15} have started ``Project Premonition'' which aims to
use drones to catch mosquitoes for detection of pathogens in them before these
pathogens make people sick. But for sending drones to catch mosquitoes we first
need to find out possible mosquito breeding areas such as water puddles. We
propose a method in which we manuevere a quadcopter to record video of the
place, and later process that video to identify the frames which contain water
puddle, which will in turn aid in the process of identifying that place for
further action.

\section{Related Work}

Rankin et al.~\cite{rankin04} have detected the presence of water from color,
texture, and the detection of reflections in stereo range data. They have used a
rule base for fusing water cues which was developed by evaluating detection
results from an extensive archive of data collection imagery containing water.
In another work, Rankin et al.~\cite{rankin11} have implemented a water detector
based on sky reflections that geometrically locates the pixel in the sky that
is reflecting on a candidate water pixel on the ground and predicts if the
ground pixel is water based on color similarity and local terrain features. 

Santana et al.~\cite{santana12}'s method for detection of water relies on the
chaotic nature of water’s dynamic texture to exploit a measure of entropy over the
trajectories obtained from optical flow trackers over several frames.

Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang10} have introduced a descriptor which is tolerant
to the flip transformation and even non-rigid distortions, such as ripple
effects (in additon to invariant to scales, rotations and affine
transformations) to detect water reflections.

\section{Methodology}
In this section we will see the three approaches; SVM classifier with HSV
histogram based feature, Optical flow based technique, and finally combination
of these two approaches to detect stagnant water robustly.

\subsection{SVM classifier}

respectively. It can be seen that puddle area has very less Hue as well
as Saturation. Also, reflective parts of puddle has high intensity.}

\subsubsection{Creation of training Data}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/trainingData.pdf}
\caption{Process for creation of training data. User selects puddle area by
drawing a contour over input frame (using our tool). User can additionally
select/deselect blocks which he/she thinks are belonging to puddle/non-puddle
area. We use blocks covered by user drawn contour as `positive' training data.
While the `negative' training data is selected from blocks which are far from
the user drawn contour.}
\label{fig:training}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Optical flow based technique}
Optical flow measures apparent motion of objects in a scene caused by relative
motion between camera and object. Hence, magnitude of optical flow will be high
for near objects while objects at large distance it will be low. Figure
\ref{fig:optical_flow} shows the magitude of optical flow calculated from two images
captured from quadcopter, consisting of water puddle region. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/IMG_PAIR_1_1.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/IMG_PAIR_1_2.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/optical_flow_magnitude.jpg}
\caption{Optical Flow. Left, middle: video frames taken from positions
which are $d$ units apart in 3D world. $ 0.01 \leq d \leq 0.1$. Right:
Magnitude of optical flow calculated from earlier images. Magnitude of optical
flow in the reflective parts of the puddle is low compared to that of its
suroundings.}
\label{fig:optical_flow}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that, the reflective part of the puddle have less optical flow
magnitude compared to its neighborhood. The reason behind this is, the reflected objects being quite far
from the actual puddle, the relative motion will be less compared to its
neighbourhood. So, we can use this property to detect water puddle regions from
the image.

We are using an algorithm  developed by Ce Liu~\cite{Liu11Thesis} which is based
on \cite{Brox04,Bruhn05} to find out optical flow. (The Matlab/C++ code for this
algorithm is given in \cite{Liu11}). \cite{Brox04} needs spatio-temporal
smoothness constraint. Temporal smoothness may be assured by taking adjacent (or
near djacent) frames from video. But, adhering to spatial smoothness constraint
is very difficult in case of UAV. 

Quadcopter provides us a way to enforce the spatial smoothness constraint on
the input images. We record Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU) data
transmitted by quadcopter, which in turn provides us the approximate position of
the quadcopter at given time. Later, we synchronize it with the video sequence
captured by quadcopter, to find out approximate position from which the given
frame is captured. Finallt, we select frame pair which is nearest, among set of
temporally adjacent frames to find out the optical flow.
